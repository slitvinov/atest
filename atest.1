.TH ATEST 1
.SH NAME
atest \- run atests
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B atest
[
.I file ...

.SH TUTORIAL
.sp
Lets create a test for a program \fI\&./example\fR
.sp
.nf
$ \&./example
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
it outputs \fB1 2 3\fR and you want to modify \fI\&./example\fR and make sure the output stay the same\&.
.sp
Create a file with a test \fItest/0\fR
.sp
.nf
# cTEST: 0
\&./example  > example\&.out\&.txt
.fi
.sp
The lines after \fI# cTEST: 0\fR are executed as a script\&. The script creates a file example\&.out\&.txt which contains a "magic" pattern \fI\&.out\&.\fR\&. This pattern tells atest to consider this file as a reference output\&.
.sp
.nf
$ atest test/0
.fi
.sp
end of the output says:
.sp
.nf
atest: 0/0 test(s) passed
atest:    1 test(s) created
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
atest and stored a reference output to a directory \fItest_data\fR\&. To run a test replace \fIcTEST\fR by \fITEST\fR in \fItest/0\fR and execute
.sp
.nf
$ atest test/0
.fi
.sp
It returns
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
atest: RUNNING: 0
atest: PASSED : 0
atest: 1/1 test(s) passed
.fi
.sp
Now if you "break" \fI\&./example\fR and run
.sp
.nf
atest test/0
.fi
.sp
it get noticed\&.
.sp
.nf
atest: 0/1 test(s) passed
atest: failed tests:
atest:     0
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
A test consists of a header line and lines which are executed as a shell script\&. An empty line ends a script\&.
.sp
.nf
# TEST: name
<script>
<scirpt>
<script>

<not a script>
.fi
.sp
cTEST means "create" mode\&. In this mode the script updates the reference file\&.
.sp
.nf
# cTEST: name
.fi
.sp
nTEST is "numerical" comparison mode\&. In this mode every number in the output is compared with the reference up to a tolerance 0\&.1\&. For a reference output \fB1 2 3\fR\&. A program which outputs \fB1\&.01 2 3\fR passes a test and one which outputs \fB1\&.11 2 3\fR does not\&.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.sp
The following environment variables affect atest\&. ATEST_DIR a directory with reference values, ATEST_C if set regenerates all test\&.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
atest atest\&.examples\&.sh

Run tests in
\fIatest\&.examples\&.sh\fR
